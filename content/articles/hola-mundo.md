I am a Software Developer, based in Seville (Spain). Currently, I work on International Business Development and Projects Department at Emergya, as Full Stack JavaScript Developer. We migrate old-fashioned websites to newer technologies for international brands, all over the world.

Although, I have spent the last four years working with JavaScript, my professional trajectory is not limited to the browser.

My first steps as Developer, at Forma Animada, involved mobile interactive storybook apps for children. At that time, we used Adobe Air for iOS and Android. Later, at Cyan Animática, I joined a magnificent senior team, working on bespoke applications and installations for large international museums in conjunction with world-known architecture studios. This gave me an opportunity to work with emerging technologies - headsets and high-end sensors.

At Cyan Animática, I switched from Air to Unity to meet the demands of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Luckily, I had an unique opportunity to learn from top-notch graphic designers and VFX Artists - awesome people and awesome professionals.

Three years later I moved to Atexis Spain, in order to lead a dedicated IT team in design and development of a complete eLearning platform for Airbus. We created both wrapper and content (technical interactive simulations to help learn and practice complex aircrafts systems).

Shortly after completing the Airbus project, I felt curious about the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node); I created some personal side projects with the explicit purpose of learning these JavaScript trends. With that new skillset, I felt ready to put it to good use, at Emergya.

I love programming, but I’ve always had a soft spot for Architecture. I dedicate time to reading, sketching and creating interactive archviz (architectural visualizations) and renders. But mostly, I open my eyes and look, and admire... and that, I guess, is the reason I discovered photography.

Now you know a bit about me. Let's talk!
